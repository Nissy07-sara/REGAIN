**Project Title:**
_**REGAIN - Mental Health Assessment**_

**Short Description:**
REGAIN is a web-based application designed to assess an individual's mental health status based on a series of carefully structured questions. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to evaluate emotional well-being and offer preliminary feedback.

**Problem Statement:**
Mental health issues often go unnoticed and unaddressed due to the lack of immediate assessment tools. Many individuals may struggle with stress, anxiety, or depression without realizing the severity of their condition. The absence of a simple self-assessment tool makes it harder for individuals to seek professional help at the right time.

**Solution Overview:**
REGAIN offers a structured self-assessment questionnaire to help individuals gauge their mental health status. Based on the responses, the system calculates a score and categorizes the userâ€™s mental well-being into different levels, offering insights into their emotional state. The goal is to promote mental health awareness and encourage users to seek professional assistance if needed.
